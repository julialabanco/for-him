      <div class="first-text">There was a time in my life when I viewed love as a fleeting shadow, something elusive and impossible to capture.</div>
      <div class="second-text">
        But then you came into my life and turned everything <br>
        around. You cast away the darkness, filling my world with a bright, <br>
        brilliant, and warm light.
      </div>
      <div class="third-text">You are the golden rays that greet me each morning, the promise of a new day full of hope and possibilities. With you, everything feels brighter, clearer, and more beautiful that it all feels like a beautiful, endless sunrise.
    </div>
      <div class="fourth-text">
        Just like that song by Taylor Swift says, I used to think love was burning red,
        <br> but youâ€™ve shown me that it's golden like daylight.

        <h2><i>You are my daylight, Masu.</h2>
        I love you so much. <br>
